`sqlmap -u [IP] -p msg --data "msg=1" --dump` - find vulnerable points and dump the database

## CC: Pen Test - SQL Injection

- `sqlmap` is probably the most popular tool to use to inject SQL into a website. It checks for various kinds of injections and has a lot of options
- Won't work in all situations, so it pays to know how to manually check for it

### Questions

- How do you select(lol) which parameter to use?(Example: in the url http://ex.com?test=1 the parameter would be test.) [`-p`]
- What flag sets which database is in the target host's backend?(Example: If the flag is set to mysql then sqlmap will only test mysql injections). [`--dbms`]

- How do you dump the table entries of the database? [`--dump`]
- Which flag sets which db to enumerate? (Case sensitive) [`-D`]
- Which flag sets which table to enumerate? (Case sensitive) [`-T`]
