# Gobuster

These are just miscellaneous notes I have for `gobuster`. There's been a couple of rooms that have touched on it.

## Common Usage

`gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o [file] [IP]` - scan for directories using a wordlist on a specific IP, and saving the results to a log file

## CC: Pen Testing - Web Enumeration

Gobuster is good for finding directories and files which are present on a website. It can also help find things like subdomains.
