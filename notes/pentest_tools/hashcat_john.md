# Hash Cracking (`john`, `hashcat`)

## Common Use

```bash
john --format=[format] --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt [password_file]
... (let it run)
john --show --format=[format] [password_file]
```

## CC: Pen Test - Hash Cracking

Most files with hashes in them either have each hash on a new line or hashes followed by their salt (`hash:salt`)

- Some algs/formats salt before and some salt after, research is good here

## Hashcat

- Renowned for versatility and speed
- No autodetection, but has modes you set ([link to modes here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes))
- Hashcat doesn't work for me...it can't run on a vm apparently (or at least not well)

## John the Ripper

- Supports a lot of formats and is very easy to use with a lot of customization options
- Probably not as fast as Hashcat, but it works on my VM, so eat that, losers...

### Questions

- What flag let's you specify which wordlist to use? [``]
- What flag lets you specify which hash format (Ex: MD5,SHA1 etc.) to use? [``]
- How do you specify which rule to use? [``]
