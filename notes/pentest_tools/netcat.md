# Netcat

These are just miscellaneous notes I have for `nc`. There's been a couple of rooms that have touched on it.

## Common Usage

`nc -lvnp [port]`: open a connection to a specifc port (usually for a reverse shell)
`nc <ip> [port]`: talk to a machine on a specific port (good for checking versions or whatnot)

## CC: Pen Testing - Network Utilities

Netcat / `nc` is a tool used to connect to specific ports for sending/receiving data. Used a bunch for reverse shells

Input is also pipeable: `echo hello | nc IP 1234` will send `hello` to `IP:1234`

### Questions

Using `man nc`

- How do you listen for connections? [`-l`]
- How do you enable verbose mode(allows you to see who connected to you)? [`-v`]
- How do you specify a port to listen on [`-p`]
- How do you specify which program to execute after you connect to a host(One of the most infamous)? [`-e`]
- How do you connect to udp ports [`-u`]
