# PenTesting Tools

This is a small side-section which goes over rooms which are in the 'Penetration Testing Tools' section of the 'CompTIA Pentest+' pathway.

I'm not planning on getting a Pentest certification, but this seems like a good list of tools to go over to learn about (and both Metasploit and Burp Suite, which are in the 'Complete Beginner' pathway, are in this section, so it seems like it's worth learning)

Pages Included:

- [`nmap`](../network_exploit_basics/nmap)
- [Metasploit](metasploit)
- [Burp Suite](burp_suite)
