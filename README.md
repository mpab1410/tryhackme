# TryHackMe

This is a basic repo that puts together all my notes and such for rooms that I am going through on the TryHackMe site.

For now, this is private, though I may make it public if this whole learning experience takes traction.

## Current Sections

`notes/` will contain notes from rooms meant to act as learning areas

As I move through the rooms, more will be added for things like `ctf/` and anything else that makes sense

## Other Notes

Some sections are missing. This is because I'm only making notes for things which I don't have a strong footing for or things where I feel notes might be overkill (i.e. all the Linux sections). I might go back and add them but I'm focused on moving forward
